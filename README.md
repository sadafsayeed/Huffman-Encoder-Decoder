# Huffman-Encoder-Decoder
This repository contains a C++ implementation of Huffman encoding and decoding algorithms for efficient data compression and decompression.

Features:
  - HuffmanNode Class: Defines nodes for constructing Huffman trees.
  - HeapQueue Class: Implements a priority queue for efficient tree construction.
  - Encoding Function: Compresses input strings using Huffman coding.
  - Serialization: Serializes Huffman trees for storage and transmission.
  - Decoding Function: Decompresses Huffman-encoded strings.
 
Usage:
  - Encoding: Use the compress function to encode input strings.
  - Serialization: Serialize Huffman trees with the serializeTree function.
  - Decoding: Decompress Huffman-encoded strings using the decompress function.
